# WindTurbineProject
The Wind Turbine Material Analysis Project was a project (Spring 2018) funded by DMDII to extend the product life cycle ontologies developed under CHAMP to answer a particular use case, allowing a materials engineer to select optimal materials based on key performance parameters. Open-source data from the wind turbine blade materials dataset at Sandia National Lab at Montana State University was used to generate RDF for the analysis. This repository contains the deliverables for this project, including the application ontology, RDF files, the final report, SPARQL queries written along with their returns, along with a final set of presentation slides.
