# WindTurbineProject
The Wind Turbine Material Analysis Project was a project (Spring 2018) funded by the Digital Manufacturing and Design Innovation Institution (DMDII) to extend the Product Life Cycle Ontologies developed under CHAMP to answer a particular use case, allowing a materials engineer to select optimal materials for a Wind Turbine Blade based on key performance parameters. 

Open-source data from the wind turbine blade materials dataset at Sandia National Lab at Montana State University was used to generate RDF for the analysis. This repository contains the deliverables for this project, including the application ontology, RDF files, the final report, SPARQL queries written for the project along with their returns, as well as a final set of presentation slides.  

Other files used include:

The ontologies extend from Basic Formal Ontology (BFO), the Relations Ontology (RO), as well as the Common Core Ontologies (CCO) developed by CUBRC, and the PLC ontologies developed under CHAMP. 


The Common Core Ontologies have their own github repository here: https://github.com/CommonCoreOntology 

Basic Formal Ontology and related files may be found here: https://github.com/BFO-ontology

The PLC ontologies may be found in the CHAMP repository here:

Contributors to these files include: Clare Paul, J. Neil Otte, Munira Binti Mohd Ali, Binbin Zhang, and Ruoyu Yang. 

Special thanks to Clare Paul at the Air Force Research Laboratory, who generously gave time to this project, and without whom this effort would not have been possible.
